# DamithPayment âœ¨

**DamithPayment** is a Java-based project designed to demonstrate payment processing functionalities. Developed as part of a university assignment, this project utilizes the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture and incorporates fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project is in its early stages, with room for future enhancements and optimizations.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project was created for the **Object-Oriented Programming** module during **Year 2, Semester 1** of university. It showcases key programming concepts such as:

- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstraction**

The system is built to simulate basic payment processing while adhering to the MVC design pattern for better separation of concerns and maintainability.
